# monsters-and-sweatpants
A text-based competitive co-op card game

To-do:
- [ ] Balance game (adjust player health, monster strength, attack/defense card values, etc.)
- [ ] Change the game so that players must use all of their cards from both their attacks and defense stacks before a new stack is generated
- [ ] Add support for console colors to make the game easier to read
- [ ] Allow the user to choose an easy, medium, or hard game play mode that will effect the player health and monster health (and maybe chance of generating more powerful cards and/or easier monster?)
- [ ] Fix a bug where the user always attacks the monster before the computer player (should be random)
- [ ] Play multiple rounds against the computer (best out of 3, best out of 5, etc.)
- [ ] Save game data to a file for statistics generation (high score, rounds played, rounds won, rounds lost, etc.)
- [ ] Allow the player to create their own cards and mosters for use within the game
